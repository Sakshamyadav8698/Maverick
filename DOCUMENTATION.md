INTRODUCTION
In this project, we have created a Billing software. 
It inputs the customer’s details and then
totals their bill by adding necessary taxes and then
showing it on a text area. The bill can also be saved in the
form of a text file with the name of the customer’s bill
number. The same bill can be searched with using the bill
number and then later can be printed and shared too.

DESCRIPTION
The program is run by executing the file GBU.py,
this file will then lead the user to a window which opens
as the name “Maverick”. There will be a random bill
no. generated every time, Then the user has to enter the
customer’s name and phone number as it is compulsory
and add at least one product, then by clicking on total
the window will show the amount and the tax on the
products added by the user. When we press generate bill,
if no products are selected this will lead to an error and if
some products are selected it will present a bill in the bill
area and ask the user if the bill has to be saved or not. If
the bill has to be saved the bill will be saved and the user
will be informed. When the user clicks clear this will clear
all the entries. If they enter a specific bill number and
click on the search button the bill of the corresponding
bill number is shown in the bill area. When the user Clicks
on exit button the window will shut down leading the user
to the home screen of the device. The bills will be saved in
a folder in the format of a text file(.txt) by the name of
their corresponding bill number. That text file can later be
shared or printed as per the user's choice.
(NOTE: For saving bills in your device you need to have a folder
named "Bills" created)

SCOPE
Our project has a huge future scope as it can be sold to
local shops so that it helps in the “Pakka bill initiative” by
Jaago Grahak Jaago or can be turned into an online
website or app which sells and delivers products online by
creating Login/Signup part and adding more products
and payment settings.
